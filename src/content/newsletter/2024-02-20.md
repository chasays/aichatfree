Summary: The scope and function of the "robots.txt" file, its role in ordering the internet, and the potential disruption caused by AI technology.

For the past three decades, a small text file known as robots.txt has been has been maintaining online order, providing an unofficial set of rules for internet operation that are coded into its framework. 

The file indicates which search engines are allowed to index a site and which ones aren't, effectively stipulating who can and can't access a website. 

However, the explosion of AI changes things. Currently, many companies use your site and its information to create massive training data sets. Unfortunately, many site owners can't keep up with the rapid pace of technology, questioning the efficacy of the robots.txt file.

Also, the agreement behind robots.txt, which was essentially "everyone just be decent", may no longer be applicable. This is especially true when it feels like AI systems are taking more than they're giving, such as data misuse.

 a group of U.S. tech giants that includes Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. 
 
 These companies' profits and market capitalizations surpass those of nearly every other country in the world. 
 
 Their combined market cap would make them the second-largest country stock exchange globally, outdoing Japan by twice. 
 
 Concerns are being raised over the risks posed by such concentration in the U.S. and global stock markets. The gains among these tech giants have been substantial, especially amidst AI hype and expected rate cuts.
 
There are signs, however, that investment opportunities in U.S. stocks could broaden out beyond these seven companies, due to the resilience of the U.S. economy and improving margins.
