  </p>
  <p>Last updated: Jan 2024</p>
  <p>
    <strong>I. INTRODUCTION.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    AI Chat Free Limited (“we,” “us” or “our”) understand that our users care about how their
    personal information is used and shared. We work hard to protect your information and take
    your privacy seriously.
  </p>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains our data protection policy and describes the types of information
    we may process when you visit our website
    <a href="http://aichatfree.info/">aichatfree.info</a> (the "Website"), install and/or use
    "AI Chat Free" software application for mobile devices (the “App”, “our App”), and more
    generally, use any of our services (the "Services", which include the Website and App).
  </p>
  <p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all users, and others who access the Services (“Users”).</p>
  <p>
    PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY, FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE WAYS YOUR PERSONAL
    INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED, CAREFULLY. WHEN YOU USE THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU
    HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF THERE ARE ANY TERMS IN THIS
    PRIVACY POLICY THAT YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH, PLEASE DISCONTINUE THE USE OF OUR SERVICES.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>II. INFORMATION WE PROCESS</strong>
  </p>
  <p>There are several categories of information that can be processed.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Functional Information</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    We ask for and process the following information when you use the Services. This information
    is necessary for the adequate&nbsp;<strong>performance of the contract</strong>&nbsp;between you and us.
    Without such information it is impossible to provide complete functionality of the Services
    and perform the requested services.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>User Content</strong>&nbsp;(i. e. the text you enter into the message field and send to
      the Services, as well as any text, other content generated by AI via the Services). Subject
      to your compliance with certain rules and restrictions outlined in our Terms of Service, you
      may dispose of, use, share, otherwise exploit your User Content for your own purposes.
      However, any use of User Content is at your sole risk, i. e. you assume and bear all risks
      and responsibility associated with your use of User Content. It is your sole responsibility
      to ensure compliance with the applicable laws while using the User Content. Please note that
      we engage the third-party service provider - OpenAI, L.L.C. - for the purpose of processing
      and creation of AI-generated User Content. Please check Section IV to learn more about the
      privacy policy and practices of OpenAI, L.L.C.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Contact Information and other information you provide to us</strong> (name, e-mail
      address, as well as any other content) which you may fill in by yourself when you set up an
      account or profile on the Services or contact us via email or other means. We use such
      information to respond effectively to your inquiry, fulfill your requests, send you
      communications that you request and perform the requested services.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Third-Party Account Login Data</strong>
      <p>
        We may provide you with the option to register and login using your third-party account
        details (like your Google, Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we
        will receive certain profile information about you from your third-party account service
        provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the third-party account
        service provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list,
        profile picture as well as other information you choose to make public on such third-party
        platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this
        Privacy Policy or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please
        note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal
        information by your third-party account service provider. We recommend that you review
        their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and share your personal
        information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Information That Is Processed Automatically</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    When you use the Services, some information about your device and your user behavior may be
    processed automatically. This information is generally non-personal, i.e. it does not, on its
    own, permit direct association with any specific individual, and we may access it only in
    aggregated form. We process this information on the ground of our&nbsp;<strong>legitimate interest</strong>&nbsp;in improving
    our Services and giving our users the best experience. If we do not access such
    data we may not be able to provide you with all the features of the Services.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use third-party automatic data processing technologies to analyze certain information sent
    by your device via our Services (advertising or analytics tools). Some of them launch
    automated processing of your personal data, including profiling, which means any form of
    automated processing of personal data used to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to
    you, in particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning your personal preferences,
    interests, behavior, location or movements (see the list of data described below). Processing
    information through automatic data processing technologies starts automatically when you first
    time use the Services.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Device Details</strong>. When you use a mobile device to access our Services, some
      of the details about your device are reported, including “device identifiers”. Device
      identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with
      your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device (but not your personality).
      Device identifier enables generalized reporting or personalized content and ads by the third
      parties.
      <p>What data can be processed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Information about the device itself: type of your device, type of operating system and
          its version, model and manufacturer, screen size, screen density, orientation, audio
          volume and battery, device memory usage.
        </li>

        <li>
          Information about the Internet connection: mobile carrier, network provider, network
          type, IP address, timestamp and duration of sessions, speed, browser.
        </li>

        <li>
          Location-related information: IP address, the country code/ region/ state/ city
          associated with your SIM card or your device, language setting, time zone. We may
          collect information about your location when you use our Services. Your location can be
          determined by GPS, IP address, sensor data from your device, information about things
          near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled
          devices.
        </li>

        <li>
          Device identifiers: Identity For Advertisers for iOS devices/ Advertising ID or Android
          ID for Android devices, user identifiers.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Information about the applications</strong>. Name, API key (identifier for
      application), version, properties of our App can be reported for automated processing and
      analysis. Some services also record the list of applications and/or processes which are
      installed or run on your device.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Cookies and similar technologies</strong>. When you use the Services, cookies and
      similar technologies may be used (pixels, web beacons, scripts). A cookie is a text file
      containing small amounts of information which is downloaded to your device when you access
      the Services. The text file is then sent back to the server each time you use the Services.
      This enables us to operate the Services more effectively. For example, we will know how many
      users access specific areas or features within our Services and which links or ads they
      clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how our Services
      is used, improve our marketing efforts, and provide content and features that are of
      interest to you. We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to the
      Services, which may use cookies or similar technologies. You may be able to change the
      preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your acceptance of cookies, but
      this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Log file information</strong>. Log file information is automatically reported each
      time you make a request to access the Services. It can also be provided when the App is
      installed on your device. When you use our Services, analytics tools automatically record
      certain log file information, including time and date when you start and stop using the
      Services, and how you interact with the Services.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Ad-related information</strong>. The following data might be reported about the ads
      you can view: the date and time a particular ad is served; a record if that ad was “clicked”
      or if it was shown as a “conversion” event; what the ad offer is about; what type of ad it
      is (e.g., text, image, or video); which ad placement is involved (where the ad offer is
      displayed within the Services); whether you respond to the ad.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>In-App events</strong>. When you use our App, analytics tools automatically record
      in-App information (tutorial steps, leveling up, payments, in-app purchases, custom events,
      progression events, method of limiting the processing of user data).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Information provided automatically to advertising or analytics tools does not generally come
    to our control, therefore we cannot be responsible for processing such information. Please
    mind that some services are engaged in personal data profiling and may obtain information
    related to your personality and/or your device by using technologies that do not belong to our
    scope of responsibility. We do not control, supervise or stand surety for how the third
    parties process your personal data, that might be collected by their own means (not through
    our Services). Any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information
    should be directed to such third parties (see Section IV).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Payment Information</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Our e-commerce provider (Google Play Store or App Store) is responsible for billing,
    processing and charging for in-app purchases, handles your personal information and keeps it
    absolutely safe and secure. This information is processed as part of the performance of the
    contract between you and us. We cannot access or use your credit or debit card information.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may access the applicable “in-app” purchase rules and policies directly from the app
    stores.
  </p>
  <p>

    Privacy policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>IV. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    When you manifestly make your information become public, your consent is deemed to be made
    through your action and we no longer need further consent from you to the extent allowed by
    applicable laws.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this
    Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may disclose Personal Information to our affiliates, meaning an entity that controls, is
    controlled by, or is under common control with us. Our affiliates may use the Personal
    Information we share in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other applicable
    laws.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that while integrating external services we choose third parties that can assure
    they apply all necessary technical and organizational measures to protect user personal data.
    However, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted from us to any such
    third party. We are not responsible for any accidental loss or unauthorized access to your
    personal data through a fault of third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will not rent or sell your personal data to any third parties, but we may share your
    information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data, with
    third-party organizations that provide automatic data processing technologies for the
    Services. We do not control or influence these third parties’ tracking technologies or how
    they may be used.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising
    partners. This information allows third-party ad networks, inter alia, to deliver targeted
    advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may engage the following third-party service providers in order to provide us with
    necessary infrastructure for delivery and improvement of our services:

    please consult the correspondent websites and privacy policies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our Services may contain links to third-party websites/services or you may access the Services

    sites or services linked to or from our Services, including the information or content

  </p>
  <p>
    We may disclose your personal information if it is needed for objective reasons, due to the
    public interest or in other unforeseen circumstances:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>as required by law;</li>
    <li>
      when we believe, in good faith, that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect
      your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
    </li>

    <li>
      if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, you

      information.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>V. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</strong>
  </p>
  <p>We work in the cross-border area and provide our Services to our Users around the world.</p>
  <p>
    We and third-party organizations that provide automatic data processing technologies for the
    Services or our third-party advertising partners may transfer the automatically processed
    information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or
    jurisdictions around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and
    jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as in your jurisdiction.
  </p>
  <p>
    This means that your personal information can be transferred to a third country, a territory
    or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or to the international
    organization where data protection and confidentiality regulations may not provide the same
    level of protection of personal data as your country does.
  </p>
  <p>
    We try to make sure that the recipient of any personal data provides a proper protection of
    the personal data received, in accordance with the current legislation on the protection of
    such information. By using the Services, you agree that we may transfer your personal data to
    any third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or
    to the international organization.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>VI. HOW LONG WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    We generally retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for performing the
    functional service of the Services and to comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer
    want us to use your information that we physically access and store, you can request that we
    erase your personal information and close your account.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, some data may still be stored for a certain time period (but no longer than the
    storage purpose requires) if information is necessary to comply with legal obligation
    (taxation, accounting, audit) or in order to maintain safety and data backup settings, prevent
    fraud or other malicious acts.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>VII. EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Applicable data protection laws give you certain rights regarding your personal information.
    You have the following options in relation to your personal information that was collected:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Data Access and Portability.</strong>&nbsp;You can request copies of your personal
      information.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Change or Correct Data.</strong>&nbsp;Where you cannot update data by yourself through
      your account, you have the right to ask to correct, change, update or rectify your data.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Data Retention and Deletion.</strong>&nbsp;The user data is generally retained for as
      long as your user profile is in existence or as it is needed to provide the relevant
      services. However, specific retention times can vary based on context of the processing
      performed. You have the right to ask to delete all or some of the personal data that is held
      about you.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Restriction of Processing.</strong>&nbsp;Under certain circumstances, you may have the
      right to limit the ways in which your personal information is used.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To exercise any of the rights described above, you can contact us at
    <a href="mailto:contact@aichatfree.info">contact@aichatfree.info</a> . Please bear in mind that
    we ensure the above mentioned rights only with respect to the information that we physically
    access and store.
  </p>
  <p>
    When your personal information is processed automatically you may object to such processing in
    some circumstances. Where your personal information is processed for direct marketing
    purposes, you may ask to cease processing your data for these direct marketing purposes. In
    order to exercise your right please contact the third party services listed in the Section IV
    of this Privacy policy to learn how you can object to processing your data. Most of them have
    clear instructions on their privacy pages, functional API or other options.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>VIII. HOW TO OPT OUT</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Opt-out of marketing tracking</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you don’t want third-party service providers to use the personalized ads on the basis of
    your interests please follow the instructions below:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Choose option “Opt out of Ad Personalization” on your Android device in Settings/ Google/
      Ads.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Please mind when you opt out of certain interest based advertising, you may still continue to
    receive contextual ads based on other non-personal information, such as ads related to the
    content of other digital products you are using.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Opt-out of Location Data Processing</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you don’t want third-party service providers to use your precise location data, or
    street-level location information about you please follow the instructions below:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Android 8.0 or later: turn Location off for the applicable Product via the menu “Settings &gt;
      Apps &gt; [applicable Product] &gt; Permissions &gt; Location”. Then turn off the “Location” button.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>IX. SECURITY</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    The security of your personal information is highly important to us. We follow generally
    accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during
    transmission and once we receive it. We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect
    personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and
    destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the
    personal information.
  </p>
  <p>
    We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction
    of information we hold, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit.</li>
    <li>
      We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical
      security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems.
    </li>

    <li>
      We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors, and agents who
      need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict
      contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to
      meet these obligations.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage,
    is 100% secure. We do our best to protect your personal data, nevertheless, we cannot
    guarantee its absolute security. In the event that your personal information is compromised as
    a breach of security, we will promptly notify you in compliance with applicable law.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have any questions about the security of our Services, you can contact us at
    <a href="mailto:contact@aichatfree.info">contact@aichatfree.info</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>X. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Our Services usually have a minimum age requirement of users and are not directed to children,
    and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data relating to children. Children should never
    disclose their name, address or phone number, or any personal information, without their
    parents’ prior permission. We consider a user to be a child if they are under the age of 18,
    unless more stringent regulation applies in their country of residence. In EU countries, users
    under the age of 16 are considered children, unless the data protection regulation of their
    country of residence specifies another age. If you become aware that your child has provided
    us with Personal information without your consent, please contact us and we will take the
    required steps to delete such information.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>XI. SPECIFIC PROVISIONS APPLICABLE UNDER CALIFORNIA PRIVACY LAW</strong>
